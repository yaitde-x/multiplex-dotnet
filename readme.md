This research was about System.IO.Pipelines vs System.IO.Stream and using them to multiplex datastreams. At the time, my company was building a Cloud -> OnPrem relay using Azure Relay. 

We were using PortBridge as a reference. The code is a bit dated and still uses Begin/End Async. If you want to see what it was like to read asynchronous code back in the day. Go check it out.

I remember being intensely focused on this project for a few weeks :). Then I went back to whatever I was doing before.

Perhaps you will find it useful.
